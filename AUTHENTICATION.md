## Authentication Implementation

In this document, I will outline the steps and components required to implement the authentication functionality in our application. The authentication system will enable users to securely log in, sign up, refresh access tokens, and log out.

## Components

- `User Model`: Create a User model in your database to store user information, including email and hashed password. We could implement a whole new model for this, or just expand the current Account model.

- `Authentication Controller:` Implement an AuthController that handles authentication-related requests, such as login, signup, token refreshing, and logout.

- `Routes`: Define the necessary routes in your application to handle authentication:

  - POST /auth/login: User login route to authenticate the user credentials and generate access and refresh tokens.
  - POST /auth/signup: User signup route to create a new user account.
  - POST /auth/refresh-token: Route to refresh the access token using the refresh token.
  - POST /auth/logout: Route to invalidate the current access and refresh tokens and log out the user.

- `Token Generation`: Implement token generation functions to generate the access and refresh tokens upon successful authentication.

- `Token Verification Middleware`: Create a middleware function to verify the access token for protected routes. This middleware should decode and validate the token, checking its expiration and signature.

- `Password Hashing`: Use the bcrypt library to hash and compare user passwords securely.

## Flow

`User Registration`:

- The user provides their email and password for registration.
- The password is hashed using bcrypt and stored securely in the database.
- A new user record is created in the User table.

`User Login`:

- The user provides their email and password for authentication.
- The controller verifies the user credentials against the stored hashed password.
- If the credentials are valid, the controller generates an access token and a refresh token.
- The access token is sent back to the client as a response.
- The refresh token is stored securely on the server or client-side storage.

`Access Token Validation`:

- For protected routes, the server middleware validates the access token provided in the request header.
- The middleware decodes and verifies the token's signature and expiration.
- If the token is valid, the request proceeds to the route handler; otherwise, an error response is sent.

`Token Refreshing`:

- If the access token expires, the client can request a token refresh by sending the refresh token to the /auth/refresh-token route.
- The server verifies the refresh token and generates a new access token if the token is valid.
- The new access token is sent back to the client.

`User Logout`:

- When the user logs out, the client sends a request to the /auth/logout route.
- The server invalidates the access and refresh tokens associated with the user, making them unusable.
